# My name is Pol Moreno

I'm currently training my abilities by completing the Game Of Active Directory lab from [Orange-Cyberdefense](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD).

My hobby is creating and developing web interfaces. In the last two years I have created about four official websites that have been used by the company or individual in question.

I'm currently finishing my Computer Network Systems Management, Specializing in Cybersecurity studies at the [Institut Tecnologic de Barcelona](https://www.itb.cat/).

In my free time, I play to play guitar and keep up with cybersecurity news.

I will try to document some of my projects in [this blog](/posts).
